Method Overriding 😏
---------------------
-> Defining the same method signature of a 		super class in the Sub class in called 		method overriding

Advantages 
--------------
-> All sub classes can provide different implementations to the same method which 
Is there in the super class
-> Can apply polymorphism 

Rules
----------
1. A sub class can over ride super class method if super class methods are non static , non-final and non-private
2. Method over loading is not possible if the
     Super class type is final
