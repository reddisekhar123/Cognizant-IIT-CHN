Garbage Collection (GC)
--------------------------
-> GC is a special algorithm which cleans up unused objects from
     The heap space
-> Mark and Sweep
-> System.gc() methods invokes garbage collection for sure.
-> before the object garbage collected, garbage collector invokes
     finalize() method.
