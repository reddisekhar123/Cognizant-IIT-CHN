Inheritance   😁
-------------
-> Inheriting features from super class/base class/parent class
     Is called inheritance.
-> Creating relationships between classes
Relationships two types
	1. Has 'A' -> Object relationships 
	2. Is 'A' -> Inheritance 

Is 'A'
---------
class A{
	feature 1
	feature 2
   
}
class T{}
class B extends A{
  	class A features and 
	feature 3
	feature 4
}

Notes
--------
	-> Only sub class can access features of super class. Vice
		 versa is not passible

Advantages 
-------------
	1. Re-usability
	2. Class relationships
	3. Better data abstraction
	4. Implementing polymorphism 

Has 'A' relationship 
--------------------
If a class contains instance of an another class -> has 'A'

Notes
--------
1. Creating an object to the class
		A a=new A(); creating an object
2. Instanciating  to the class
		A a=MakeObject.getObject(); 
		A a1=MakeObject.getObject();

class MakeObject{
	public static A getObjet(){
// ----
	return new A();
    }
}

Types of Inheritance 
	Two Types
	1. Single 
	2. Multiple
	
Java Supports only Single Inheritance type.
Multiple Inheritance is not allowed in Java
