Constructor Overloading
------------------------------
1.  If you are trying too create an object to the sub class with out any parameters, then proving default constructor in the super and
Sub classes are mandatory. JVM adds them for you automatically.

2. When you provide parameterized constructor in the super class, 
    And not proving any default constructor, then you cannot create
   An object to the sub class (with out parameter). In this case, 
i. Provide default constructor	in the super class
ii. Remove parametarized constructor constructor in the super class
iii. Invoke, parameterized constructor from the default constructor o the sub class by using super keyword


3. When ever you are trying to invoke super class parametarized constructor  then providing default constructor in the super is not mandatary operation. 

4. Invoking the parameterized constructor of a sub class must be followed by a default constructor in the super class or removing parametarized constructor in the super class
