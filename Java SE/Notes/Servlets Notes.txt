What happens when a client send request to a servlet first time?
1. Web Container takes the request, and opens 
     Web.xml file (DD)
2. WC Checks the given url name in the <servlet-mapping> section.
3.  WC executes the Servlet class which is 
     Corresponding to the given URL
4. WC creates Servlet class object, if that was not created earlier.
5. If the Servlet class object creation is successful or already available, then WC starts calling life cycle methods 


Servlet Life Cycle Methods
--------------------------------
1. Init
2. Service
3. Destroy

1. Init
-----------
-> init methods calls only once in the life cycle
2. Service methods
--------------------
-> For each request service method is called every time
3. Destroy
-------------
-> Destroy method got called by the container when the servlet is finished its job/ Server restarted/Servlet Context object is recreated.


Rules 
-------
