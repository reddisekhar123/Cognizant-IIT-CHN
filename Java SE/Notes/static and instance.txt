Static methods and properties
-------------------------------------
Static data:
-> static data is sharable to every objects in all classes
Instance data:
-> instance data copy is not sharable to every object. Every objects
     Contains a separate copy of all instance data.

Notes:
-> Static method directly can not use non static data.
-> Non static methods can access directly static and non static data
-> static methods can access only static data directly
-> we need object in a static method to access non static data
-> we need object in non static methods to access non static data   of  other classes
-> static data of same class can be called directly from the same class.
-> static data of other classes can be called with a class name of that static data which is having static methods
-> calling static data in a same class or different class using objects is not recommended. 





System.out.println();

1. System class belongs to java.lang package
2. Out is a static object of type java.io.PrintStream class which   defined in System class
3. Static data can be called with class name if that data belongs to in other class. So out can be called with a class name System.
4. By calling System.out , you will get java.io.PrintStream class object as a return type.
5. On top of java.io.PrintStream class, you can access all methods
    Of PrintStream class
6. println() method belongs to java.io.PrintStream class.
7. So we can directly invoke println method using System.out.println();
