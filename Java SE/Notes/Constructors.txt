Constructor
---------------
-> its a special member block in a class
-> Invokes by JVM when the object is created.
-> Name of the class and constructor name must be same
-> constructors do not have return types. Even void not allowed
-> Constructors may have arguments


Notes
-------
1. JVM provides a default  constructor if you 
    Are not providing any parametarized   constructor
2. When yo provide a argument constructor, then JVM will not add a default constructor automatically. 
3. When you provide a argument constructor,
     Then proving a default constructor is mandatory operation if you are trying to invoke default constructor.
