Method Overloading
------------------------
-> Defining the same method name with different signature 

Method signature
--------------------
	-> name of method
	-> number of arguments
	-> type of arguments 
	-> position of arguments 
Advantages?
---------------
	-> readability
	-> same method to perform many operations
EX: println();

Notes
----------
-> its a static polymorphism concept. (Compile time decision)
