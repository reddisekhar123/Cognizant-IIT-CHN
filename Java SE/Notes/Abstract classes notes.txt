Abstract class
---------------------
-> An abstract is a method specification which contains zero or more abstract methods and concrete methods
-> An abstract class do not specify body.
-> Abstract methods must be defined only with in abstract classes
-> We cannot create object to an abstract class. But we can create 
     a reference to an abstract class
-> The terence of an abstract class can be used to access all the methods in the abstract class and overridden in the sub classes
-> The reference of the abstract class cannot be used to access the individual methods of a sub class (a method which is available	only in the sub class and not available in the super class.)
-> Every sub class of an abstract class must override every abstract method in the abstract class.
-> Any any one of abstract method is not overridden in the sub class then that sub class must be defined as 'abstract'
-> A class can be either abstract or final. It cannot be both.

Issues
------------
1. Abstract classes cannot achievement 100% abstraction. We can implement only partial abstraction 
2. Code is tightly coupled with abstract classes. 
3. Application cannot be extended. 
4. Multiple inheritance is not possible
