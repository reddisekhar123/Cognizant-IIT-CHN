Inheritance Notes
----------------------
1. Java.lang.Object class is the superclass to all the classes in Java
2. A super class object/reference can store all its sub classes/ implementation class objects.
3. Super class reference can able to access every method and properties in the super class.
4. Super class reference cannot be used to access the individual methods of its sub classes (a method which is not available in super class and only available in sub class)
